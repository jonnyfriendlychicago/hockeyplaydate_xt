            This is a placeholder page for what eventually will be the all-about-hockey-playdate page. <br/>
            As of now, envisioned that this page will display same content to Non-authenticated users and authenticatd users.  <br/>
            This will be the history, purpose, mission, guiding principles, etc. of hockey playdate, along with corporate structure info, etc. <br/>
            Will presumably also contain contact form, etc.
