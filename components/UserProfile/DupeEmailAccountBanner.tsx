            Hello, <strong>{nameString}</strong>! Ok, this is awkward â€” sorry in advance.

          <p>
            You cannot use Hockey Playdate with your current login. Here is a quick explanation, plus options to resolve this situation. 
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3 className="font-semibold">Explanation:</h3>
            <p>
                There are two ways to join Hockey Playdate at the signup/login screen:
                </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-1 ml-4 space-y-1">
                <li>
                    Method 1: &ldquo;Continue with Google&ldquo; (refered to as  <em>googleSocial</em> )
                    </li>
                <li>
                    Method 2: Email + password (referred to as <em>emailPassword</em> )
                    </li>
              </ul>
            <p className="mt-2">
                Both methods work... <em>and each method will create a separate and distinct user account for Hockey Playdate.</em>
                </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Here is the problem: the account you&#39;re logged in with right now (account type: {accountType}) has the same email address - <strong>{email}</strong> - as another Hockey Playdate account, 
                which means this {accountType} account is a duplicate.
                </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
              For security and sanity reasons, Hockey Playdate blocks your duplicate account; this {accountType}-based account cannot be added to groups, it cannot view other members, it cannot engage with events, etc. 
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 className="font-semibold">Resolution Options:</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-1 ml-4 space-y-2">
              <li>
                <strong>Option 1: Disregard this new account</strong><br />
                Log out, then sign in using your original login method. Use that going forward, all good. Don&#39;t worry about this duplicate account: our system will automatically deactivate it in 7 days.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Option 2: Use this account instead</strong><br />
                If you want to abandon your original account and use this {accountType} login going forward,
                <a href="/support" className="underline">contact our tech support team</a>. 
                We can deactivate your old account, and then you can use this new {accountType} account going forward.  
                Be advised that none of your old account data will transfer over: you will need to be re-added to groups, etc.  In short, you&#39;ll be starting over with Hockey Playdate. 
              </li>
